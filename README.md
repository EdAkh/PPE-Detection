# PPE-Detection

Computer vision project were the goal is to create a model capable to detect personal protective equipement on construction and industrial workers.

I used Roboflow framework to store the images, labelized them and split automatically the data for train, validation and test.
The model architecture for the training is YOLO NAS L.
Web application built with Flask framework, with the current features: upload images from local folder or from a web link, display input and output. (more will be added)
